# Arduino DTMF Generator
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/dilshan/dtmfgen.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/dilshan/dtmfgen)
 
This is a library to generate DTMF tones only using *Arduino Uno*. It is designed to work with R-2R ladder based DAC to produce DTMF tones.

## DTMF Generator API

### DTMFGenerator class
Try to create only single instance of DTMFGenerator class in global space. For example:

    #include "dtmfgen.h"
    
    DTMFGenerator dtmf;
    
### Class methods

#### generate
**Description:** Generate DTMF tone for specified symbol or number.

**Syntax:**

    generate(key, duration)
**Parameters:**

 - *key*: Symbol or digit as a character. 
 - *duration*: Length of the tone in milliseconds.

**Returns:** none.

**Example:**

    dtmf.generate('3', 100);

Above example generate DTMF tone relates to digit 3 for 100 milliseconds.
